## Description

The main task of the virtual driver assistant is supervision and minimizing the chance of causing an accident due to insufficient attention of the driver. 
The project was created as part of an engineering work at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology. The project covers the logical part of the presented system. Cameras are simulated with video files.

### How it's working

The system detects and marks the selected markings and objects:
* Stop
* Crosswalk
* Speed-limit
* Build-up area (start and end)
* Speed-control
* Traffic lights

In addition, the system analyzes the posture of the person driving the vehicle. If the behavior of the driver is classified as dangerous - then he is warned with a light signal. Passing signs icons will appear on the screen if the driver is driving safely.
